<p>-Reusable coffee cups are designed with insulation in mind. This keeps your drink hot 
or cold for a much longer time by "trapping" the hot or cold inside the cup. Single-use 
coffee cups, on the other hand, are typically made from paper or plastic and do not provide 
much insulation.Reusable cups are better for the environment.As well, many disposable cups 
aren't even recyclable. Even many cardboard disposable cups are lined with plastic to make 
them waterproof, and this plastic cannot be separated from the cardboard. Reusable cups are 
more sustainable and will reduce your waste.
