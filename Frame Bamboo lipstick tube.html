<p>-A bamboo lipstick tube provides a unique and long-lasting experience to the customers, 
for one who is not sure about the benefits of lipstick tubes. It also helps to enhance longevity 
and protects your customers from allergies, and their long-lasting usage is a highlight.
Up until 1915, lipstick was kept in silk paper, when the first metal push up lipstick tube was 
invented by Maurice Levy. Soon after, major cosmetics companies started to sell lipstick tubes as well.
The first swivel lipstick tube, which is what we commonly see used today, was created in 1923, by James
Bruce Mason Jr.Lipstick tubes have a piece that moves upward to push more lipstick out as you use it. 
Make sure that piece is as far down as possible before you pour.
