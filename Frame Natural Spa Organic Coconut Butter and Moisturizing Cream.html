<p>-Coconut oil helps your skin retain moisture, so you may want to use it on wet skin. Avoid using 
coconut oil in areas prone to acne. Coconut oil acts as a sealant, as it helps trap water into the skin
to keep it moist. Hydrating and moisture-repairing products can help. And coconut oil is one of those 
ingredients that helps your skin retain moisture.
